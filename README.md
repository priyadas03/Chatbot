## **Brief on Chatbots**🔎🔎🔎🔎
"A chatbot or chatterbot is a spftware application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech , in liut of providing direct contact with a live human agent."

**Chatbots are one of the most frequently seen AI  us in our daily life!**

##🌠🌠 **The first chatbot was Eliza created in 1966**

## Rule based chatbots
Rule-based chatbots are a type of chatbot that operates based on a set of predefined rules and patterns. These rules guide the chatbot's responses to user inputs, typically through if-then logic.

## Self learning chatbots
Self-learning chatbots, often referred to as AI-driven or machine learning chatbots, leverage advanced techniques in artificial intelligence, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning to improve their performance over time. Unlike rule-based chatbots that rely on predefined rules and responses, self-learning chatbots can understand and adapt to new inputs and contexts, making them more flexible and capable of handling complex interactions.

# **How chatbot works**
Chatbots operate by interacting with users via text or voice interfaces, utilizing various technologies to understand, process, and respond to user inputs. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how chatbots typically work:

## **1. User Input**🎓🎓
Text Input: The user types a message or question.


Voice Input: The user speaks a query, which is then converted to text using speech recognition technology.

## **2. Input Processing**🎓🎓

📣**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The chatbot uses NLP techniques to understand the input. This involves:


📣**Tokenization**: Breaking down the input into individual words or tokens.


📣**Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying the grammatical structure of the input.


📣**Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities such as names, dates, and places.


📣**Intent Recognition**: Determining the user’s intent or the purpose behind the input.


📣**Context Understanding**: Keeping track of the conversation’s context to provide relevant responses.

## **3. Response Generation**🎓🎓

💡**Rule-Based Systems**: If the chatbot is rule-based, it matches the input against predefined patterns and generates a response based on set rules.


💡**Machine Learning Models**: If the chatbot is AI-driven, it uses machine learning algorithms to generate responses. This involves:


💡**Training Data**: Using large datasets of previous conversations to train the model.


💡**Model Inference**: The model predicts the most appropriate response based on the input and context.


## **4. Action Execution**🎓🎓
Database Queries: The chatbot may query a database to fetch information needed for the response.
APIs and Integrations: The chatbot can call external APIs to perform actions like booking a ticket, checking the weather, or retrieving account details.

## **5. Response Delivery**🎓🎓

⌛**Text Output:** The chatbot sends a text response back to the user.


⌛**Voice Output:** For voice-based chatbots, the text response is converted to speech using text-to-speech (TTS) technology and delivered to the user.

## **6. Learning and Improvement**🎓🎓

✈️**Supervised Learning:** Involves training the chatbot with labeled data where the correct responses are provided.


✈️**Reinforcement Learning:** The chatbot learns from interactions over time, improving its responses based on user feedback and rewards.


✈️**Feedback Loops:** Continuous learning from user feedback, corrections, and new data to improve accuracy and relevance.

## **Components of a Chatbot:**🎓🎓

📍**User Interface:** The platform through which users interact with the chatbot (e.g., messaging apps, websites, voice assistants).


📍**NLP Engine:** The core component that processes and understands user inputs (e.g., Google Dialogflow, IBM Watson, Microsoft LUIS).


📍**Backend Systems:** Databases, APIs, and services that the chatbot interacts with to fetch data and perform actions.


📍**Machine Learning Models:** Algorithms that enable the chatbot to learn from data and improve its responses over time.


📍**Conversation Manager:** Manages the flow of the conversation, maintaining context and handling transitions between different topics or intents.

## **Example Workflow:**🎓🎓

📍**1. User:** "What's the weather like today in New York?"


📍**2. NLP Engine:** Processes the input, identifies the intent (weather query), and extracts the entity (New York).


📍**3. Backend Systems:** Calls a weather API to fetch the current weather data for New York.


📍**4. Response Generation**: "The weather in New York today is sunny with a high of 75°F."


📍**5. User**: Receives the response and continues the conversation.


🌠🌠By leveraging these technologies and processes, chatbots can provide efficient and effective interactions, enhancing user experience and automating tasks.
